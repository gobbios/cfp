# cfp

This is a collection of some functions that I personally use regularly.

To install the current version, use the following command:

`devtools::install_github("gobbios/cfp")`

The package should come with a handful of documents that explain some of the contents. A list of the available documents can be seen via

`vignette(package="cfp")`

And if you want to open one, use:

`vignette("sequenceanalysis", package="cfp")`

In case these documents don't show up, you can try to install and create them manually (although this might require Latex to be installed on your system, not sure):

`devtools::install_github("gobbios/cfp", build_vignettes=TRUE)`

If you want to install a specific version of the package, you can use `install_github("gobbios/cfp@v.0.1.0")`, which installs version 'v.0.1.0'. To find out which versions are available check out https://github.com/gobbios/cfp/releases.
